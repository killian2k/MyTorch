# MyTorch
This project consists of coding the bases of neural network frameworks. Based on Pytorch, it only uses Python, the basic libraries including Numpy.
I first coded the classical Multi-layers perceptron then the CNN and finally the RNN with LSTM cell and RNN Phoneme Seq-to-Seq (Forward and backward).
